# TheRealBook6
Creating a csv file for the Real Book 6 using the Apotify API

See https://gormansam.github.io/TheRealBook6/ for the markdown file.

Due to the limitations of information from the Spotify API, some of the information doesn't match up perfectly. 
Generally keys are within a step of the circle of fifths, if wrong at all, and track.artists represents the artist from the playlist track, not necessarily the original author of the song (as found in the real book).

The Real Book can be found at: https://escuelasuperiordejazz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-real-book-sixth-edition.pdf

And the spotify playlist can be found at: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50BquW1FAVYhYx4KWLgwGD
Big thanks to spotify user skathis for compiling this playlist.
